Experimenting with YOLO and how seeing how I can use it in a unique way.

Personal notes - When running code (in PowerShell) use command:

    Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force

This lets you override the restriction to run scripts in order to allow to run virtual environment. Then:

    env/Scripts/Activate.ps1

In order to actually activate the virtual environment.

    source env/bin/activate
    
Activates virtual environment on linux environment.
